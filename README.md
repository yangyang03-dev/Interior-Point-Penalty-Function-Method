## Introduction 

This is a simple toy project made with Matlab®. In 2024 I have done an interesting experiment with **How to find the location of a base station**. I have made some naive assumption about the actual scenario, thus, it will become easier to implenment the code

## Background

Since the advent of 5G technology, China's mobile Internet has been rapidly developing, laying a solid foundation for the country's digital economy. From 4G to 5G technology, both transmission speed and latency have been greatly optimized. In order to further increase the coverage of the mobile Internet and improve the transmission quality of existing base stations, a large number of new mobile base stations have been built in 
various regions in recent years. Considering factors such as the distribution of communication equipment and the interaction with the electromagnetic field, selecting appropriate locations for base stations can maximize economic benefits.

## How to use it

It's pretty **straightforward**! You can load the .m file to your Matlab® application directly and see what happens. Also, if you would like to test with real data, you can change the coodinate of the points, change the parameters of the lines and the population index of each points. It is also possible to change the restrains
